# 88.0-1.0.0 [Darling]

Best Girl just got _better_. ‚ù§Ô∏è

![Best Girl](https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/best_girl.png)

_Zero Two's Not Just A Cutie. ;)_

**4 New Themes!**

- I decided that I didn't have enough Zero Two themes, so I fixed that. She now has a new top-tier dark hacker theme: `Obsidian`. I also felt like Red Zero Two doesn't get enough attention, so I added a light `Sakura` theme which features her as she was as a child. With all these new Zero Two themes, I thought it would be best to rename the existing dark & light themes to \`Rose\` & \`Lily\` respectively.
- It wouldn't be the _Darling_ release if I didn't include Hiro as well. (Dark Theme)
- Lastly, this is the first release with a duo theme! (Nao's doesn't count, I just wanted the melon meme.) Just to pad my Zero Two theme stats, I've now got a Hiro & Zero Two couples' dark theme.

### Other Stuff

- Desaturated Itsuki's theme a bit.

# 84.1-1.0.0 [Light Theme Party]

![v84 Girls](https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/v84_girls.png)

This release is not for my Dark Theme Normies. Dark themes are nice, but I like Light Themes too (and my Dark Theme Normies). I'm currently trying new things out. Sorry in advance if I made your eyes bleed. I might tweak some of them as time goes on, still not 100% on what looks good & also is a fun color.

**6 New Light Themes!**

- Tired & broken down programmers rejoice! Even though you will never be pampered by a real Fox-demigod, you can now at least code with one. Let "The Helpful Fox Senko-san" watch over you as complete your tickets. You can almost feel the "„Åä„Åã„Åà„Çä„Å™„ÅÆ„Åò„ÇÉ" you will never get üò≠
- I decided to complete my Quintessential Quintuplets collection by adding the oldest and youngest quint: Nakano Ichika & Nakano Itsuki.
- Tomori Nao, from Charlotte, has an interesting dichotomy when it comes to her personality. She is super cute tho.
- Have I ever seen Code Geass? No. Can I appreciate C.C. without having seen the anime? Yeah buddy.
- Guess while I'm talking about "anime I haven't seen but, chose to make a theme because the girl is pretty." We now have Yuzuriha Inori from Guilty Crown.

# 78.0-1.0.0 [The Boys]

I'm trying to bring in a bit of inclusion.

**4 New Dark Themes!**

- I can already hear you now, "Rimiru Tempest, from 'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime', is not a boy. They are the best genderless slime, get your facts correct." Yeah well....shut up.
- Next, is one of the S ranked heroes in the 'One Punch Man' universe, Genos.
- After that, is the smug smile of Yukihira Soma from Shokugeki no Soma. 
- Lastly, I am going to be honest, I haven't seen Haikyu. I just wanted a Indigo & Orange based theme. So here is Hinata Shoyo.

### Other Stuff

- Updated some of Rory, Ram, & Rem's syntax highlighting colors to be more usable.

# 74.1-1.0.0 [Synapse break. Vanishment, this world!]

**4 New Dark Themes!**

- Decimate errors in the code alongside the Wicked Lord Shingan. Let your inner fantasies go rampant with Rikka Takanashi from: "Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions". 
- It is comfy time! Don't let feature requests stress you out, because you can now code with Nadeshiko from Yuru Camp. 
- A Certain Scientific RailGun go: bzzzzzzt. Zap bugs out of existence with the electromaster Mikoto Misaka.
- Raccoon + Tanuki = one really cute cinnamon bun. Enjoy your time coding with Raphtalia from: "Rising of the Shield Hero."

# 8.0.0 [Holiday Release]

**3 New Dark Themes!**
 
- Celebrate Christmas with Chocola from the NekoPara Series!
_I lied about Shigure being the last addition from NekoPara._

- The 4th of July now just got even better, now that you can code with Essex from Azur Lane.
If you prefer a more canon experience, Essex's theme also has **secondary content** with the Eagle Union branding.

- Even though I missed this year's Halloween, I've got something to look forward to in 2022.
Yotsuba, from The Quintessential Quintuplets, isn't 2spooky4me.
